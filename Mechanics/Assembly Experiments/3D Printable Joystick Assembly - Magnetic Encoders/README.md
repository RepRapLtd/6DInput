# Assembly Information
This is a simple concept model to explore the feasibility of modeling the entire joystick assembly with an infinitely "scrolling" dial.

**This design is not complete and will not function in its current state.**

Magnetic Angular Position sensors were used in this example, but are interchangable with hall effect sensors.
